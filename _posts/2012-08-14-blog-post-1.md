## Question 1 (500 words or less)

**Prompt**: In 500 words or less, please discuss:  
1) why you are interested in pursuing a career in physics, astronomy, or a closely-related field,  
2) what your academic and career goals are, and  
3) how being a Cal-Bridge Scholar will better enable you to achieve those goals.

> Throughout my journey, mathematics has been more than just a subject; it has been the backbone of my academic and intellectual growth. From the age of four, my parents instilled in me a love for numbers, they helped me memorize multiplication tables and bought me math workbooks during summer breaks to teach myself. As I progressed through the education system, my talent in mathematics became apparent, but the path ahead remained uncertain. Neither of my parents had attended university, and while I excelled in math, moving between school districts constantly for financial reasons made it difficult to find a path to university.  
>
> Choosing mathematics as my major and intending to use it as a foundation for a field I felt passionate about in the future would be the first step on my path to university. Delving into computer science my freshman year and seeing the connection between Math and Computer Science led me to discover Data Science. The thought and potential I saw by being in an environment where I could combine Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science excited me. It was then that I knew I wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in Data Science, leveraging my mathematical foundation and computer science skills to significantly contribute to this new field.  
>
> Beyond academic pursuits, my aspirations extend to effecting meaningful change in the communities I grew up in. Having been guided and supported by mentors throughout my academic and professional journey, I understand the value of mentorship and support networks. As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I aspire to give back by developing high school programs, similar to what I’ve done under Santa Rosa Creek Foundation and their Marine Science programs but for Data Science. By providing access to education and opportunities in this field, I hope to empower individuals from underprivileged backgrounds to pursue careers in STEM and become drivers of change in their communities.  
>
> As I set my sights on a Ph.D. in Data Science to not only aid the research that is pursuing the creation of Artificial General Intelligence but also to be a leader in the outreach of the field, I recognize the importance of a supportive community and mentorship. This is where the Cal-Bridge Scholar program comes in. Being part of a cohort of like-minded peers who have experienced similar challenges and triumphs will provide invaluable support and camaraderie. Additionally, having access to mentors who have navigated the path ahead will offer guidance and insights crucial for my academic and career growth.  
>
> In conclusion, my journey from mathematics to data science has been shaped by a passion for problem-solving and a desire to effect positive change. Pursuing a Ph.D. in Data Science is not just a personal goal but a means to contribute to my community and inspire future generations. Through the support of the Cal-Bridge program, I am confident that I will be better equipped to achieve my academic and career aspirations while making a meaningful impact on society.

## Question 2 (250 words or less)

**Prompt**: In 250 words or less, please describe a few of your characteristics, accomplishments and/or past experiences that will make you an excellent Cal-Bridge scholar.

> Throughout my university journey, I've defied the odds and showcased resilience and dedication in bridging gaps and excelling in challenging disciplines. Early on in university, I realized that I had fewer opportunities in high school compared to my peers, because of how many had access to programs like dual enrollment that allowed them to have a head start. However, I committed to closing the gap and surpassing expectations.  
>
> Consistently challenging myself by undertaking extra courses in Computer Science and Statistics, in all my summer quarters, I steadily narrowed the disparity between my peers and I. Simultaneously, I remained engaged in uplifting underrepresented communities. As a high school mentor and calculus tutor, I provided support to students from diverse backgrounds, leveraging my own experiences to inspire and empower them. Additionally, serving as Vice President of the largest LatinX club at my university, I facilitated events for community-building, not forgetting to include creating and leading the club soccer team to two championship victories.  
>
> Amidst this, I also achieved noteworthy academic milestones. Notably, being one of the select few Mathematics majors accepted into the data science minor and taking on a research position in an interdisciplinary collaborative project with people from Math, Physics, and Engineering backgrounds at the start of my Junior year highlights my academic prowess and interdisciplinary aptitude. Additionally, my success in notoriously challenging courses shows that as a Cal-Bridge scholar, I would bring not only academic prowess but also a drive to contribute meaningfully and inspire others from underrepresented backgrounds.

## Question 3 (250 words or less)

**Prompt**: In 250 words or less, please tell us about one of the most difficult challenges that you have faced in your life, how you overcame it, or how not overcoming it has affected you. This challenge can be either academic or non-academic.

> One of the most challenging obstacles I've faced in my life has been battling with self-doubt, largely stemming from my struggle to find a sense of belonging due to my mixed heritage. Being the child of immigrants from Mexico City and Sri Lanka, I've often felt like I didn't fit in anywhere.  
>
> Growing up, I grappled with labels from both sides of my heritage, feeling like I didn't fully belong to either. This constant struggle with identity left me with a pervasive sense of self-doubt, because very few I looked up to related to having seen this perspective of life.  
>
> I feel this self-doubt often when I’m within my LatinX community, because I know that I’m not fully latino by blood. Nevertheless, I've managed to surmount this challenge by embracing the philosophy upheld by the founders of Mexico City: "We are not people of words but of action." This mantra serves as a reminder that my identity and my devotion to my community are not dictated by labels, whether self-imposed or imposed by others.  
>
> Being a person who speaks through action is what has allowed me to be a leader not only in my LatinX community, but also in my work with the Santa Rosa Creek Foundation when developing support mathematics material for high school students and helping fellow mentors build connections with their students. While self-doubt was a difficult challenge in my life to overcome, it pushed me to be the best leader and example I can be for others.
